I work as a doctor in the field of Gastroenterology and have always been attracted by images.
My passion for travelling, mountaineering and the wilderness have played an important role
in becoming a photographer. From high school I started learning about photography while studying
the works of Ansel Adams, Charlie Waite and Marc Adamus, which are my biggest inspiration.
I bought my first camera in 2008 and since then I learned a lot about photography while following
the works of other photographers and through intensive practice. The first years I made a lot of
mistakes but from 2012, after four years of intensive research I approached photography more seriously.

We live in a digital world where we are bombarded by billions of pictures every day
and get to experience many viewpoints of the same subjects, therefore it is difficult to
capture an iconic image. I approach landscape photography as a form of art and
before pressing the camera shutter I know in my mind how I want the final image to
look. I always try through my photography to capture and transmit the feelings
I experienced when pressing the camera shutter and I am constantly working towards
improving myself as a photographer. As both with medicine and photography you
can never reach perfection, and perseverance has always been my guidance.
The photos that can be viewed on this website were taken from 2012 until now and
are the results of 10 years of hard work. In this period, I captured a lot of images, but
I strive to show only my best and most representative work.
